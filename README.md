# Advanced Image Picker

This is my custom Image Picker that enabling you to multiple pick image and [Adv Camera](https://pub.dev/packages/adv_camera) with our Custom UI

*Note*: This plugin is still under development, and some Components might not be available yet or still has so many bugs.

## Installation

First, add `adv_image_picker` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Notes

If you are about to load the image in thumbnail size, it is recommended to get the image bytes from AdvImagePickerPlugin.getThumbnail
Otherwise, it will be causing memory issue

```
adv_image_picker: ^1.0.6
```
